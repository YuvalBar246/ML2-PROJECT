# ML2-PROJECT

In our project, we will use the code published from the previous course and further develop it. We will create an EDA (exploratory data analysis) and visualize different relations between variables. We will compare different forecasting methods and focus on a statistical analysis of which customers the bank should target to be as profitable as possible. The Visualization will be shown using Gradio.
